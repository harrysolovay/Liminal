# Patterns Overview

`structured-outputs` was designed to enable the creation of libraries that abstract over the core
types described in [the types section](../types.md). The aim is to enable an ecosystem of libraries
that make available reusable types for common use cases.

These types' context can be parameterized, such that end developers can apply context as necessary
([see context section](../context.md)).

## Requesting Patterns

If you have an idea for a `structured-outputs` pattern library, please feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/harrysolovay/structured-outputs/issues/new) in the GitHub.

If you already created a library, please feel free to submit a pull request that adds it to the
"Pattern Libraries" list of this very documentation.
