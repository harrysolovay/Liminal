# Patterns Overview

`structured-outputs` was designed to enable the creation of libraries that abstract over the core
types described in [the types section](../types.md). The aim is to enable an ecosystem of reusable
type libraries.

Such library types can have parameterized context, thereby enabling end developers to apply context
as necessary ([see context section](../context.md)).

## Requesting Patterns

If you have an idea for a `structured-outputs` pattern, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/harrysolovay/structured-outputs/issues/new).

If you've already created a library, please submit a pull request that adds it to the "Pattern
Libraries" list of this very documentation.
